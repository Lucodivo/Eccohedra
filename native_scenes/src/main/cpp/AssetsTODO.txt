- There is major bug with compression that seems to turn yellow into blue and blue into yellow.
- Integrate compressinator into an actual dependency to the git repo
- Mipmaps
    - Probably just bake mipmaps with the help of compressinator
    - Double check that OpenGL can't just generate mipmaps for us, though I believe with compressed textures it cannot.
- I don't believe I need to use JSON for my baked assets at all...
- They should just be compiled into the binary as raw strings.
    - Using the asset_baker might be overkill but there's no reason we need to manually be reading shaders through AAssetManager
- asset_baker cache should take into consideration the assetlib version number
