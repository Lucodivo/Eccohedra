- There is major bug with Compressinator that turns red into blue and blue into red for ETC2 RGB & RGBA
    - This bug has a quick and dirty fix in this project of simply swizzling red & blue before sending it to Compressinator
    - Issues marked here:
        - https://github.com/GPUOpen-Tools/compressonator/issues/244 & https://github.com/GPUOpen-Tools/compressonator/issues/247
    - Consider fixing the Compressinator bug and issuing a PR
- Integrate Compressinator into an actual dependency to the git repo (currently just installed on personal computers)
- Mipmaps
    - Probably just bake mipmaps with the help of compressinator
    - Double check that OpenGL can't just generate mipmaps for us, though I believe with compressed textures it cannot.
- I don't believe I need to use JSON for my baked assets at all...
    - They should just be compiled into the binary as raw strings.
    - Would allow us to remove nlohmann Json as a dependency for the application
- Remove lz4 dependency from the Android application.
- Using the asset_baker might be overkill but there's no reason we need to manually be reading shaders through AAssetManager.
- asset_baker cache should take into consideration the assetlib version number and potentially the baker's own version?
