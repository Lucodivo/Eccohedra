Improve iteration speed:

Optimization ideas:
- [Placeholder]

Modularization ideas:
- matrices library (NoopMath.kt) could be set up to be pulled from a maven repository instead of manually embedded into the project

Scene improvements:
- Mandelbrot scene
    - Increase max zoom
        - Best potential solution seems to be utilizing Perturbation Theory.
        - Failed attempts were made at trying to emulate higher floating point precision in the fragment shader.
    - Let user choose two accent colors
- Native scene
    - Loading animation? (Might be a worse experience if loading is fast enough...)

Refactoring:
- Scenes save format was previously used for loading from JSON files. World information is now hardcoded
 to reduce asset reads. Refactor save format code as it contains much superfluous code.

Bugs(?):
- Exiting a scene seems to sometimes show a frame or two of the users home screen wallpaper
