Improve iterative process:
- Asset-Baker should automatically run before running the application.

Optimization ideas:
- Calm Sea and Polluted Earth skybox textures can be downscaled to match
    - Tried downscaling and didn't look great...
    - Potentially use ASTC NxM compression for larger (or all) textures?
        - [Android developer guid says support is lower than ETC2 but I don't believe it affects](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/asset-delivery/texture-compression) but I don't believe that will affect anyone who might run this app.
        - Could always compress to ASTC and

Modularization ideas:
- matrices library (NoopMath.kt) could be set up to be pulled from a maven repository instead of manually embedded into the project
- Use Asset-Baker to validate and bake shader files to strings
    - Consider minifying glsl code in the baking process to reduce bytes going to the GPU
        - https://github.com/laurentlb/Shader_Minifier
    - Failed attempts to were attempted using glslang/glslangValidator/glslc and CMake
- Shaders can be pre-compiled by the users device on the startup of the app (or first run) to the specifications of that device.
    - This prevents the need for further compilation of GLSL
    - search terms: GL_OES_get_program_binary

Scene improvements:
- Mandelbrot scene
    - Increase max zoom
        - Best potential solution seems to be utilizing Perturbation Theory.
        - Failed attempts were made at trying to emulate higher floating point precision in the fragment shader.
    - Let user choose two accent colors

- Native scene
    - Loading animation? (Might be a worse experience if loading is fast enough...)
    - Gate casting shadow onto self?

Refactoring:
- Scenes save format was previously used for loading from JSON files. World information is now hardcoded
 to reduce asset reads. Refactor save format code as it contains much superfluous code.
- purge raw texture/model assets from the repo and store them somewhere else to be downloaded separately.
- Remove json from baked assets (does not *currently*

Bugs(?):
- Exiting a scene seems to sometimes show a frame or two of the users home screen wallpaper
- Lock the native scene in it's orientation (portrait/landscape). Right now it is buggy.
