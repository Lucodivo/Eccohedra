Improve iteration speed:
- Introduce glslang to build system (either cmake or gradle) to validate glsl shaders at compile time, instead of waiting until runtime

Optimization ideas:
- Baking assets ahead of time into custom formats can reduce the amount of runtime massaging of data
necessary for models, textures, or skyboxes (texture arrays)
- Shaders could be stored as a constant string to avoid asset/resource file decompression/reads? But
would this conflict with compile time glsl validation?
