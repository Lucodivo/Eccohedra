== Scene Improvements ==
Gate Scene:
    - Calm Sea and Polluted Earth skybox textures can be downscaled to match
        - Tried downscaling and didn't look great...
        - Potentially use ASTC NxM compression for larger (or all) textures?
            - [Android developer guid says support is lower than ETC2 but I don't believe it affects](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/asset-delivery/texture-compression) but I don't believe that will affect anyone who might run this app.
    - No need to load all textures/models at once. Can load just the Gate scene textures and only other scene(s) visible. Then load others in background.
    - Gate casting shadow onto self?
    - input sensitivity is different when changing theta/radius depending on whether the app is running in portrait mode or landscape (maybe desired? requires testing.)
    - Projection & View matrices can be multiplied and sent to the GPU as a single matrix
Mandelbrot Scene:
    - Increase max zoom
        - Best potential solution seems to be utilizing Perturbation Theory.
        - Failed attempts were made at trying to emulate higher floating point precision in the fragment shader.
    - Don't block while grabbing mandelbrot index from data store
Menger Prison Scene:
    - Don't block while grabbing menger index from data store

== Overall Improvements ==
Modularization:
    - matrices library (NoopMath.kt) could be set up to be pulled from a maven repository instead of manually embedded into the project
    - Use Asset-Baker to validate and bake shader files to strings
        - Consider minifying glsl code in the baking process to reduce bytes going to the GPU
            - https://github.com/laurentlb/Shader_Minifier
        - Failed attempts to were attempted using glslang/glslangValidator/glslc and CMake
    - Shaders can be pre-compiled by the users device on the startup of the app (or first run) to the specifications of that device.
        - This prevents the need for further compilation of GLSL
        - search terms: GL_OES_get_program_binary
Refactoring:
    - purge raw texture/model assets from the repo and store them somewhere else to be downloaded separately.
    - Remove json from baked assets (does not *currently*)
README:
    - include portal scene
    - improve upon the building process
    - edit HowToPortals.md after to accommodate change in method
Bugs(?):
    - Exiting a scene seems to sometimes show a frame or two of the users home screen wallpaper

== Build Improvements ==
- Migrate from Kapt to KSP
- Optimize build variants for compilation speed
    - https://developer.android.com/build/optimize-your-build

== Etc. ==
- Use some sort of linter for Kotlin and C++
- Put app version on display in the settings
- Store listing:
  - Youtube video should be in landscape, as that is how it is presented on the store page.
